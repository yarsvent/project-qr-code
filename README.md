## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- Flexbox
- Google Fonts API

### What I learned

I learned to use Figma and style guides, write README for Github, use Google Fonts API and center elements within a body using a container.

### Continued development

I want to focus on advanced CSS, using flexboxes and semantic HTML.

### Useful resources

- [Google Fonts API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/getting_started?hl=en) - How to import and use Google Fonts.
- [Height 100%](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23583055/height-in-percentage-isnt-working-works-in-pixels) - Making the container for the QR code card take 100% of the body's height (I used 100vh).
